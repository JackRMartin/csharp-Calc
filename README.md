# csharp-Calc
This program is a simple calculator that I am working on to improve my C# skills!

Currently only supports using one operator (+,-,*,/)
numbers and operators must be entered using the buttons ( can't be typed)

# To Do
- allow user to type their calculations into the text box rather than only using buttons
- support multiple operators
- store previous calculations in memory
